# GoromiSerenityBasic

## Description of project

This is where my basic learning for Serenity will go. i am attempting to learn it so i can use rust to write a discord libary. i want to see if rust will be a better canidate for the Goromi discord bot. if so it will likely be rewritten in rust on a seperate branch.

it will be targeted for a Linux environment primarily as Goromi would be running on a linux server. i will also take this project as the time to learn how to create a podman or docker container for this application. this will prevent me from having to run and test the application on multiple operating systems. if for some reason the rewritten goromi bot takes off, then i will likely migrate it over to openshift or kubernetes.

actual code will be written to this repository once i finish the rust book. also i have have not actually done much becuase i have been very busy. once you start seeing activity it will likely be frequent.

this repo's liscensed with unlicense.
